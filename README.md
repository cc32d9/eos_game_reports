# EOS Games Fairness reports

This is a set of scripts that analyze the activity of games on EOS
blockchain and produce statistical reports.

Up to now only EOSBet Dice (https://dice.eosbet.io/) is analyzed, and
corresponding reports are presented in "reports/eosbet_dice/" subfolder.

The data is generated by ZMQ Plugin for `nodeos`:
https://github.com/cc32d9/eos_zmq_plugin

The ZMQ Plugin receiver scripts are used to store all blockchain events
into a MySQL database: https://github.com/cc32d9/eos_zmq_plugin_receiver

The reports are fenerated by scripts in this repository. The date in the
report file name indicates the end of collection period. The start of the
period is always the beginning date of the whole blockchain.
